## 🧪 Lab 1

### 📌 Overview
This lab focuses on practicing **advanced JavaScript concepts**, including:
- Objects and methods
- Array manipulation
- Function arguments
- Closures
- Dynamic function creation

---

### 📄 index.html
- Basic HTML file to run JavaScript code.
- You can switch between JS files by commenting or uncommenting the `<script>` tags.

---

### 📄 index1.js – Sorted Linked List
- Implements a custom linked list using an array.
- The list is always **sorted**.
- Supported operations:
  - `push` / `pop`
  - `enqueue` / `dequeue`
  - `insert`
  - `remove`
  - `display`
- Throws errors when invalid operations are attempted.

---

### 📄 index2.js – Reverse Function Techniques
Demonstrates different ways to reverse function arguments:
- Using **rest parameters**
- Using `arguments` with:
  - `call`
  - `apply`
  - `bind`

Results are printed in the console for comparison.

---

### 📄 index3.js – Dynamic Getters & Setters
- Defines an object with properties and methods.
- Generates getters and setters dynamically using `getSetGen`.
- Uses:
  - `Object.keys`
  - Closures
